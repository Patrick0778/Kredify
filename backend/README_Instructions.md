# Kredify Backend â€“ System Overview & Implementation Instructions

This document outlines the architecture and implementation steps for building a blockchain-based credential issuance and verification system using Cardano, IPFS, and Aiken smart contracts.

---

## 1. Backend Enhancements

### a. Credential Upload & Metadata Automation
- **Automate file upload to IPFS** (already discussed).
- **Generate standardized credential metadata** (CIP-25 or custom schema).
- **Store metadata and IPFS hash in your database** for audit and retrieval.

### b. Smart Contract (Aiken) Integration
- **Compile and deploy Aiken smart contracts** for credential minting and verification.
- **Backend should interact with Aiken contracts** (e.g., via Lucid or Mesh SDK) to:
  - Mint credential NFTs referencing the IPFS metadata.
  - Enforce institution signatures/authorization in the contract logic.
  - Optionally, allow revocation or updates (if your contract supports it).

### c. Verification Endpoint
- **Create an endpoint for employers/institutions to verify credentials:**
  - Accept a credential NFT ID or hash.
  - Fetch on-chain metadata and validate via the Aiken contract.
  - Optionally, cross-check with your backend database for additional info.

---

## 2. Frontend Enhancements

### Credential Issuance Portal
- For institutions to upload credentials, sign, and mint via the smart contract.

### Verification Portal
- For employers to input a credential hash/NFT and get instant verification status.

---

## 3. Database Schema Updates

### Track issued credentials:
- Store credential metadata, IPFS hash, NFT ID, issuing institution, student info, and status (active/revoked).

---

## 4. Security & Authorization

### Institution Authentication:
- Only authorized institutions can mint credentials (enforced both in backend and Aiken contract).
- JWT or OAuth for institution login.

---

## 5. Aiken Smart Contract Design

- **Credential Minting Policy:** Only allow minting if the transaction is signed by an authorized institution.
- **Metadata Validation:** Optionally, validate structure or required fields in the contract.
- **Revocation Logic:** If needed, allow revocation by the issuer.

---

## 6. Example Workflow

1. Institution logs in to the portal.
2. Uploads credential file (image/PDF).
3. Backend uploads to IPFS and generates metadata.
4. Backend/Frontend builds a mint transaction referencing the metadata.
5. Aiken contract enforces minting policy (e.g., only institution can mint).
6. Credential NFT is minted on Cardano.
7. Verification portal allows anyone to check the NFT and metadata on-chain.

## 7. Suggested Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js/Express, Prisma (PostgreSQL), IPFS SDK, Blockfrost SDK, Lucid/Mesh SDK for Cardano, Aiken for smart contracts.
- **Frontend:** React (with wallet integration for signing).
- **Smart Contracts:** Aiken (compiled and deployed to Cardano).

## Summary Table

| Area           | Modification/Integration Needed                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| File Handling  | Automate IPFS upload, metadata creation                        |
| Smart Contracts| Use Aiken for minting/verification, enforce institution policy |
| Minting        | Use Lucid/Mesh SDK to interact with Aiken contract             |
| Verification   | Endpoint/portal for on-chain credential validation             |
| Security       | Auth for institutions, contract-level signature checks         |
| Database       | Store credential, NFT, issuer, status                          |
